# Carbon Footprint Calculator 
The his console application calculates the carbon footprint generated by three sources. Energy usage, waste and traveling.

#Getting Started

# Prerequisites
This project was implemented with python programing language,  and it has the following dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib

You must install them using pip:
pip install matplotlib numpy

# Installing
you must fist clone the repository in to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/eddixoncu/carbon_foot_print_m602a.git


# Application
To run the applicatio yuo should exceute the command:
python main.py

It will show a set of five options:

CREATE RECORD option lets the user generate a new registry of emission of CO2.
UPDATE RECORD option lets the user update a registry of emission of CO2.
SEE ALL DATA option display all data stored by the application.
GENERATE REPORT generates a bar chart report of all data stored.
CLEAR SCREEN cleans the console screen.

The behaviour of CREATE and UPDATE is similar since they first ask for the year of the record and then request the remaining data (according to Figure 1). If a record is being created and this new one exists previously, it will be updated. On the other hand, if the record is being updated and this one doesnâ€™t exist, it will be created. These actions are executed with no interaction with the user.
